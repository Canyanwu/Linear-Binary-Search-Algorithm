# Linear-Binary-Search-Algorithm

The file netflix2019.csv contains the list of Netflix releases (movies and TV shows) from 2019. I am measuring the execution times of two movie lookup algorithms( Linear and binary search algorithm). I will only check whether or not the movie is available to compare both algorithm easily.
The first algorithm uses linear search by looping over every row and checking whether the title matches the given title. The second algorithm starts by sorting the releases by title and then answers each query with a binary search. Let's compare the performance of both algorithm for looking up 5,000 titles contained in file target_titles.txt.
